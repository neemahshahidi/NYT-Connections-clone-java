# NYT-Connections-clone-java
## Neemah Shahidi CSIS10A Project
This is my attempt at creating a clone of the New York Times mini game - [Connections](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections). If you have never heard of the game click the link and maybe even give it a try, its an excellent Brain Warmup.
The game gives you 16 words, and the goal is to find 4 groups of 4 words that are connected (Hey maybe that's why they named it connections). 
### How to run the game through the terminal 
`javac *.java` 
`java -cp . Game`
