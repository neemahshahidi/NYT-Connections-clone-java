# NYT-Connections-clone-java
## Neemah Shahidi CSIS10A Project
This is my attempt at creating a clone of the New York Times mini game - [Connections](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections). If you have never heard of the game click the link and maybe even give it a try, its an excellent Brain Warmup.
The game gives you 16 words, and the goal is to find 4 groups of 4 words that are connected (Hey maybe that's why they named it connections). 
### Increments of the Project
My main goal of the project is to get a running game that is playable through the console. Once I finish that, the dream is to make the game similar to the one on the [NYT Website](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections) by using JavaFX. Ideally I can make a Connections game in which I can control and possibly allow my mom to use as a learning tool for her teaching at the DLI.
